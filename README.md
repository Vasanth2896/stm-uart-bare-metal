# stm-uart-bare-metal

## description
My first bare metal implementation of UART using stm32f407 discovery board 
My starting point was from a udemy course created by Kiran Nayak => https://www.udemy.com/share/102agi3@cd0sfk_qk_vVOvrXrjZbi7U_77sZdtspgJ-UD76zeOHl2Pe_sce6OoDKzeobFD1qAQ==/

## What the code does.

Infinite loop of hello world transferred via uart
